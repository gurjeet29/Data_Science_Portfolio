# Fake News Classification

The dataset can be found in this link: [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data)

## Project Objective
We have all seen fake messages forwards on our WhatsApp. Generally, these articles are generated by bots and internet trollers and are used with an intent to intrigue the audience and mislead them. Fake news can be very dangerous as it can spread misinformation and inflict rage in public. The purpose of this project is to predict the news as fake or true based on their context.

## Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Deep Learning
* Artificial Neural Networks

## Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* Jupyter
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Sci-Kit Learn (for data handling)
* Keras & Tensorflow

## Project Description
The dataset contains records of 20800 rows along with following columns:

- id: unique id for a news article
- title: the title of a news article
- author: author of the news article
- text: the text of the article; could be incomplete
- label: a label that marks the article as potentially unreliable

## Training
**Simple ANN Model using Keras**   

A Bidirectional LSTM model is trained with 100 hidden neurons and 1 output neuron with the sigmoid activation function consisting of the following Hyperparameters-

    - optimizer: `'adam'`
    - loss: `'binary_crossentropy'`
    - metrics: `'accuracy'`
    - batch_size: `64`
    - epochs: `30`

## Further Improvements
We can further imporve the model by changing hyperparameters and trying other range of values using GridSearchCV. But it is important to note that, as we will increase number of parameters in GridSearchCV, our time for training will also increase.
