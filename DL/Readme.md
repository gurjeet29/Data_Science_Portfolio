- ### Deep Learning

  - [Butterfly Species Classification](https://github.com/gurjeet29/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/main/DL/Butterfly%20Species%20Classification): A deep learning model to predict butterfly species by giving an image as an input.

  - [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/gurjeet29/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/main/DL/Churn%20Modelling%20using%20ANN): A deep learning model to predict which customers are likely to leave a service or to cancel a subscription to a service. It is a critical prediction for many businesses because acquiring new clients often costs more than retaining existing ones.

  - [Fake News Classification](https://github.com/gurjeet29/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/main/DL/Fake%20New%20Classification): The objective is to classify the news from the dataset as fake or true and also to detect what kinds of topics or keywords appear frequently in real news versus fake news. I have used Bi-Directional Long Short Term Memory to classify news as fake or true news.

  - [Face Recognition](https://github.com/gurjeet29/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/main/DL/Face%20Recognition): Face recognition is a method of identifying or verifying the identity of an individual using their face. Face recognition systems can be used to identify people in photos, video, or in real-time. Law enforcement may also use mobile devices to identify people during police stops.

  - [Face Emotion Recognition](https://github.com/gurjeet29/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/main/DL/Face%20Emotion%20Recognition): Facial expression recognition is the task of classifying the expressions on face images into various categories such as anger, fear, surprise, sadness, happiness and so on.

  - [Object Detection](https://github.com/gurjeet29/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/main/DL/Object%20Detection%20Using%20SSD%20MobileNet): Object detection is a computer technology related to computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos.
  
  - [Hotel Customer Prediction](https://github.com/gurjeet29/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/main/DL/Hotel%20Customer%20Prediction): An ANN project that predicts the customers who are going to check-In in a hotel based on their past records. The project can help hotels to keep track of their customers and improve their services as to avoid cancellation. Booking cancellations have a substantial impact in demand management decisions in the hospitality industry.
